# Bussiness Promotion Agency
This project adds backend functionality to our existing front-end web application https://bpa-ks.netlify.app/. This website tends to help small businesses by allowing them to promote their products on our website. Art, culture, and food products can be promoted on this site. Backend functionality is written in PHP, while the database used to store information about the products and the web's users is MySQL
